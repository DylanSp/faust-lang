## Prior art

- [Eiffel](https://www.eiffel.org/) is the giant in this field.
- Joe Duffy's [blog posts about Microsoft's Midori project](http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/); [The Error Model](http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/) is the post that goes into detail about their contract-based system.
- Hillel Wayne's [ideas about a modern contract-based language](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/six-programming-languages-id-like-to-see/) are also a source of inspiration. Also see [this blog post of his](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/contracts/) summarizing contracts and referencing existing languages/libraries which use contract-based ideas.

## Implementation

- https://github.com/DylanSp/llvm-bindings-test is a simple test project I created to try out the [llvm-bindings](https://github.com/ApsarasX/llvm-bindings) library.
